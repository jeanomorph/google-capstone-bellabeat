**Disclaimer:**

While I wrote the analysis, cleaned the data, interpreted the results, and structured the case study myself, I used AI as a supporting tool for parts of this project.

Specifically:

* Some R functions and visualization techniques I wanted to apply were not covered in the Google Data Analytics Certificate,
* So I used AI to help validate my approach,
* Provide syntax guidance, and
* Accelerate troubleshooting.

All decisions, insights, interpretations, and explanations in this project were made by me.
AI did not generate the case study for me — it simply helped me apply techniques that required additional R knowledge beyond the course material.
