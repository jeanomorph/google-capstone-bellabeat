**Bellabeat Case Study (Google Data Analytics Capstone)**

**Author:** Jeanelfe Joy Delfinado

**Output:** HTML (.html)

**Tools Used:** R, tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, ggplot2

**Overview**

This project analyzes Fitbit user activity and sleep data to generate insights for Bellabeat.
The goal is to understand user habits and support marketing strategy for the Leaf wellness tracker.

The HTML report includes:

* Data cleaning
* Transformation
* Visualizations
* Insights
* Recommendations
* Full code (echo = TRUE)

**Packages**

* tidyverse for data wrangling
* lubridate for date handling
* janitor for cleaning
* ggplot2 for visualization

**Disclaimer:**

While I wrote the analysis, cleaned the data, interpreted the results, and structured the case study myself, I used AI as a supporting tool for parts of this project.

Specifically:

* Some R functions and visualization techniques I wanted to apply were not covered in the Google Data Analytics Certificate,
* So I used AI to help validate my approach,
* Provide syntax guidance, and
* Accelerate troubleshooting.

All decisions, insights, interpretations, and explanations in this project were made by me.
AI did not generate the case study for me — it simply helped me apply techniques that required additional R knowledge beyond the course material.

**About Me**

Hello, my name is Jean. I decided to make this section light-hearted because I want to show my personality too, not just the technical side. I also placed this at the bottom since my story might be boring for some. 😅

During college, I couldn’t make up my mind about what path I really wanted, so I ended up shifting programs twice. My parents played a big part in this. In my last year of high school, I wanted to take entrance exams at prestigious universities, but they discouraged me because they said they would still send me to the local college in our town anyway. So, I didn’t take the exams. Still, I would say I was smart enough — I wouldn’t have been in the top 10 of the class otherwise. (My ranking was actually higher, but I lost it because I never joined extra-curriculars due to my conservative parents discouraging me from joining competitions.)

I first enrolled in Accountancy during my first year of college. The school director convinced me that it was a good choice because I could become an accountant after graduating. To be honest, I only took it because of her encouragement — and looking back, she probably did that because the program was new and they needed students.

After 3 semesters, I realized I didn’t like the environment, so I shifted to Architecture because a lot of people told me I was good at designing. I was also in a different school at this time because my parents had moved to another city for livelihood. A professor in Architecture also influenced me — he saw me scribbling in my notebook while waiting for the next class, and he convinced me to shift. It seems there’s a pattern here. 😂

I spent 4 semesters in Architecture. I genuinely enjoyed my time there — the environment, the people, and the professors. But I wasn’t fully “in it” because I was going through something personal. Eventually, I had to stop for one school year. I was devastated. Four years had passed and I was still in college. I felt like a burden.

After one school year, my mom encouraged me to go back to college. I returned to my hometown and re-enrolled in the same college I went to before. I was torn between BSIT and BTVTED. I chose BTVTED (Bachelor of Technical Vocational Teacher Education, major in Food Service Management) because I liked cooking. I finished that degree with an Academic Excellence Award. After passing the board exam and taking the oath, the pandemic came.

At the start of the pandemic, everything was uncertain, but I was still positive about the path I was taking. I started working as a college instructor for a one-school-year contract. At the same time, I also enrolled in a master’s program called Master in Technological Education. But by the second semester, I dropped out because I wasn’t sure anymore if this was what I wanted. The pandemic made me rethink my entire career path.

Then my former lecturer from a review center shared a post about data science. I was intrigued — that post basically started my data science journey. The course was offered by a government agency, and there were many pathways. I chose data engineering. It was free, but it required rendering service afterward. I didn’t finish it because the curriculum wasn’t structured properly (it was new). They would tell us to take Course 3 or 4 before taking Course 2 just to understand the lessons. I didn’t like the mess. Around that time, Google offered the Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I applied for financial aid and got approved. When I saw the structure, it was so much better. That was back in 2021 when I first started.

Why did it take me years to finish? After my contract ended, I didn’t renew and was determined to find an online job instead. I took a bunch of free courses — HubSpot Academy, Meta Blueprint, Google Skillshop. After 4 months, I landed a role in a small digital marketing agency. The job post only required someone familiar with Facebook Ads. I studied Meta Blueprint, learned the structure of FB Ads, and just applied. Even without experience, they chose me. My job didn’t have a formal title, but the work I did for 3.5 years fell under Technical Marketing Operations. There was a lot of problem-solving involved. I was still taking the Google DA course, but it wasn’t my priority.

When my time with the agency ended and I returned to studying the course, I realized that I had already been doing a lot of data analytics work — data cleaning, tracking setups, and even learning about the data layer (which was new to me but gave me a basic understanding of coding).

Now that I’m almost done with this program from Google, I honestly didn’t think I could generate something like this. My past self wouldn’t believe I’d ever learn R. But looking back, data has been part of my life all along. When I wanted to lose weight, I tracked my steps and learned about calorie deficit. When I got my first online job, I used spreadsheets to track my finances. I guess data was already in me — I just didn’t realize it yet.

And now, I’m finally choosing a path not because someone told me to, but because it genuinely feels right. And that makes this journey worth it.
